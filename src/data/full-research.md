## Introduction

Every historical truth has been integrated into a weaving of relationships, lives, and tales that influence how we perceive the past. This report aims to document the experiences of enslaved individuals and those who enslaved them who were connected to Franklin College from its founding in 1787 to its merger with Marshall College in 1853. By digging into these individual identities, we hope to offer a more open and human viewpoint on a trying period in the college's and the country’s history. The relationship between slavery and Franklin College is more than simply institutional history; it also recounts the tale of real people whose daily lives were marked by suffering, determination, and complicated relationships. Franklin College was a part of this environment, connected by its trustees, founders, students, and professors. 
Historic Rock Ford’s Witness Stones Project, with which we are collaborating on this initiative, aims to commemorate individuals who have been overlooked and underrepresented in the historical narrative, serving as a crucial component of an ongoing effort to confront the past. It seeks to restore a voice to individuals whose lives have been forgotten by examining documents and revealing personal information (Rock Ford, 2025). This information will then be used to create stones placed in historic downtown Lancaster City to commemorate those who were enslaved there. This project, of utmost importance, invites the Franklin & Marshall (F&M) community, the greater Lancaster community, and readers everywhere to reflect on the meaning and consequences of these histories in our lives today. We open the door to a better tomorrow and a deeper understanding of our community by honoring those who were enslaved and sharing their experiences. 
The institution of slavery is multifaceted and took many different forms depending on geography. The southern slavery that we typically see portrayed in media and history classes is not how enslavement looked everywhere. In fact, there is a misconception that slavery ceased to exist in the Northern states. However, we know that this is not the case; states North of the Mason-Dixon Line had a relationship with slavery that was different from the South. Though less overt, the institution of slavery was still embedded in society in the North. 
We can see how ingrained slavery was in the North by looking at Lancaster County. In 1780, Lancaster County was home to 807 enslaved individuals, comprising 394 males and 412 females, ranging in age from 2.5 to 60 years old. Scotch-Irish residents owned two-thirds of these individuals, while the remaining third was owned by English, German, Huguenot, and Welsh families. The Pennsylvania Gradual Emancipation Act of 1780 introduced several vital provisions, marking a significant legal shift toward limited rights and eventual emancipation. These included the following: all enslaved individuals had to be officially registered, or become free; children born to enslaved mothers after March 1, 1780, would not be enslaved but would have to work as indentured servants until they were 28; and enslaved people were to be tried in courts like other citizens. Between 1780 and 1831, Lancaster County recorded the births of 427 children to enslaved parents, 118 before 1790, 138 from 1790 to 1800, 81 from 1800 to 1810, 72 from 1810 to 1820, and just 18 between 1820 and 1831 (Clark, 2011). Thus reflecting a steady decline in enslaved children's births following the passage of Pennsylvania’s Gradual Emancipation Act.  
In 2022, F&M published a Legacy of Slavery Report, which examined the college’s connections to the institution of slavery. This report included a list of original trustees of Franklin College who were known to have been enslavers, as documented in tax and census records (F&M, 2022). Our research expands upon these findings because we cross-listed these names with another list of names that Rock Ford provided, which included people they determined to have been enslavers. After conducting thorough research, we found that most of these enslavers/trustees had deep connections to Franklin College. This was confirmed by the early graduate classes and the first board of trustees, as documented in the school records, which showed that the enslavers' children, some of their grandchildren, and relatives had attended the college (Baer, 1848).


## Methodology

While most of our research was conducted at LancasterHistory's archives, we began by accessing the resources available at F&M’s archives to find biographical information about the people we were researching. Then we went to Lancaster History to access the register created after the Gradual Abolition Act of 1780, to find information about those who were enslaved. We also accessed marriage, baptismal, and burial records, as well as family histories at LancasterHistory. As we gathered more information about the list of people we were researching, we cross-referenced some of that information with the founding documents of Franklin College. 


## Results

Several members of the Franklin College Board of Trustees from 1787 to the early 1800s, such as William Hamilton (1787–1813), Jasper Yeates (1787–1817), Adam Reigart Sr. (1787–1813), Adam Reigart Jr. (succeeding in 1813), John Hubley Esq. (1787–1821), and Paul Zantzinger (1787–1816), also appeared in historical records as enslavers, highlighting the complex and troubling connections between the college’s leadership and the institution of slavery during that period.
We also got a list of their children who attended Franklin College in 1848. The junior class in 1848 included notable students such as James H. Hamilton and James H. Reigart, Esq., who graduated on September 13, 1848, while other members connected to the Reigart family included Rev. Samuel W. Reigart, D.D. (1859) and Emanuel C. Reigart, Esq. (1857-58), reflecting the continued presence of prominent local families in the college community during that period.
The following scholars entered the English school at Franklin College during 1787–1788: William Hamilton, Jasper Yeates, John Hubley, George Moore, Michael Hubley, Samuel Hubley, Henry Hubley, Henry Moore, John Yeates, Sarah Hand, Dorothy Hand, Catherine Hand, Charlotte Hubley, Juliana Hubley, Augusta Hubley, Margaret Moore, Christopher Reigart, John Reigart, Henry Reigart, Edward Hubley, and George Hubley (Baer, 1848). 
After going through the records of these enslavers, we were able to reveal that William Hamilton owned more enslaved people than previously listed, beyond the two named Adam and Ephraim; additional records identify a 14-year-old Black girl named Esther, a 14-year-old boy named Loby, and an approximately 8-year-old boy named Ben under his ownership. Further evidence from runaway slave advertisements referencing these individuals confirms Hamilton’s ownership. It substantiates the expanded list of enslaved people connected to him. At the same time, records also show that out of the eight enslaved individuals held by Paul Zantzinger, who were James, Faly, Polly, Bill (listed twice), Dinah, Louisa, and Bell Gardner, we discovered that he also enslaved Isaac, a young boy about 9 to 10 months old. John Hubley and Jasper had the same number of slaves in the list, which had the exact number of people they enslaved. After the Gradual Act of Abolition, we found that all these individuals had at least owned an indentured servant who served until they were 28 years old, or some who were sold to them for a short period. This demonstrates the more profound and more extensive involvement of some Franklin College trustees in slavery than initially documented.


## Conclusion

The research we conducted reveals a connection between the original trustees and students of Franklin College and the institution's involvement in enslavement. This demonstrates a strong institutional link between Franklin College and the institution of slavery. Consequently, the legacy of the college's founders is more complicated than previously known. With all the information that was found, the Witness Stone Project will not only create a space of awareness and acceptance but also a community where our past is embraced with truth by recognizing not only those who participated in slavery but also those who were enslaved. Each of these slaves had a remarkable story to be remembered, not just as slaves, but also as individuals who made significant contributions to this community.
